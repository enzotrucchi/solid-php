# SOLID Principles üêò PHP üêò

## 1. Single-responsibility Principle (SRP)

:mag_right: A class must have one and only one reason to change, which means that a class must have only one job.

## 2. Open-closed Principle (OCP)

:mag_right: Objects or entities must be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## 3. Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

:mag_right: Let Q (x) be a demonstrable property on objects of type T. Then Q (y) should be demonstrable for objects of type S where S is a subtype of T.
  
## 4. Interface segregation principle (ISP)

:mag_right: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does not use, or clients should not be forced to rely on methods that they do not use.
  
## 5. Dependency Inversion principle (DIP)

:mag_right: Entities must depend on abstractions, not concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but must depend on abstractions.
